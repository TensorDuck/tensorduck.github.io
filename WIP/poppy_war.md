R.F. Kuang is an exceedingly young author that wrote an absolutely brutal trilogy: _The
Poppy War_, _The Dragon Republic_, and _The Burning God_ forming the Poppy War trilogy.
At first, I was skeptical. When I started with _The Poppy War_, I was coming off the
high of reading the Green Bone Saga by Fonda Lee, so I wasn't sure if anything could
compete. Well, this Goodreads suggestion really panned out.

R.F. Kuang is a masterful storyteller. Not only is her writing superb and just a joy to
read, she really knows her history. Her trilogy roughly follows the history of China
prior to the Second World War, during, and after during the Chinese Civil War. She
infuses the story with the perspective of an average Chiense citizen during that time
period - a perspective that is often lost in the average American education. But more on
that later. The one warning I would give readers though: her description of war-time
atrocities is very accurate. Perhaps too accurate for some people. And the saddest part
is that she's not making any of it up. She's describing the real atrocities committed
by Japanese soldiers during the second world war. If anything, there's a chance she
even toned it down.

She mixes in that history with her own idea of magic. In _The Poppy War_, Runin is a
lowly peasant who through hard work and determination, manages to earn her place in her
home country's (Nikara's) military academy. There, Runin discovers she's a shaman, and
possesses the ability to summon the power of a god. For Runin, it's a highly destructive
and uncontrollable Phoenix. But this is not just a tale of a girl with magical powers.
Instead, Kuang manages to weave an entire narrative about religious belief surrounding
Runin's power, and how the religious beliefs shape the interaction between Runin and
other foreigners with different religious beliefs. At the same time, she even adds
science fiction elements with characters trying to understand and control the power
Runin and other shamans possess through experimentation.

Somehow, the combination of all those elements just works. Kuang manages to balance the
science with religion, the eastern versus western religion, the history with the fiction
masterfully. But a few things really stuck out to me and I just had to find a place to
gush about it.

## History from a Different Perspective

The first thing to notice about her stories - it draws heavily from Chinese history. But
the history is from the perspective of a Chinese peasant in the 1900's, not the typical
history that is taught in the US. As a result, I felt that I understood much more about
modern day China as a result.

And Kuang is very subtle about how the history mixes in with her own story. She
accomplishes this with small details. The story follows a peasant girl Rin and you feel
her helplessness at her life situation. Not just through her poverty and class status.
But when Rin fights in a war, she feels hopeless and technologically out-matched by her
opponents. Later as she encounters more people in her journey, she starts to even feel
the weight of condescension from the foreigners she encounters. For example, in the
second book she encounters a missionary who by all accounts is polite, but still sees
her as barely human due to her being "uncivilized" - a real feeling that many Chinese
probably felt as their country was occupied by multiple foreign powers.

Reading the book, I was forced to rethink much of what I learned in school. In a way, it
even gave me a better understanding of my parent's and grandparent's generations. The struggles
they must have faced and in the end, what motivated them so strongly to escape it. Kuang
really managed to get the reader to sympathize with the plight of Chinese people in the mid 1900's.

## Kuang Includes ALL the Bad Parts of War

This is a small point, but Kuang manages to capture all the bad parts of war down to the
worst details and handles the events with the deference they deserve. Authors like
George R. R. Martin will give cursory mentions to atrocities committed in a war. But
Kuang leans hard into the details and describes all the worst parts of it. I read about
the rape of Nanjing in school, but those books only talk about the numbers, estimates,
and if you're lucky, how historians came up with the estimates. But none of that
compares to reading about the actual accounts of victims. In this way, the true weight
of all the mass murders, rapes, and other crimes committed during the Rape of Nanjing is
felt by the reader. And the sad part is, she didn't have to exagerates or make up any
stories. Kuang is definitely an author who can write a convincing anti-war argument
simply from the perspective of how much suffering is imparted onto civilians as a result
of any war.

## Rin the Protagonist is Complicated

Rin evokes a lot of sympathy. She grows up poor, she's looked down upon by everyone she meets, and she starts off just wanting to escape poverty, a noble goal! As she experiences war, she witnesses and experiences the atrocities first hand and we feel the same pain she
does. And at the end of the first book, when she chooses to end the war by effectively destroying her enemies' island (much like how the US dropped two atomic bombs in Japan), the reader feels the complexity of that decision. Kuang shows the conflict that can exist in any
war, of logically knowing it's wrong to commit a genocide, even in response to a genocide, with the emotion of wanting revenge after experiencing a genocide. This logic versus
emotion fight plays out and the reader feels both sides of the argument. And it's hard to not
agree with what she chooses in the end. Even though I know logically she shouldn't have done it, I can't help but feel the same visceral satisfaction she does from finally ending the war and saving her people.
