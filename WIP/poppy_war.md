R.F. Kuang is an exceedingly young author that wrote an absolutely brutal trilogy: _The
Poppy War_, _The Dragon Republic_, and _The Burning God_ forming the Poppy War trilogy.
At first, I was skeptical. When I started with _The Poppy War_, I was coming off the
high of reading the Green Bone Saga by Fonda Lee, so I wasn't sure if anything could
compete. Well, this Goodreads suggestion really panned out.

R.F. Kuang is a masterful storyteller. Not only is her writing superb and just a joy to
read, she really knows her history. Her trilogy roughly follows the history of China
prior to the Second World War, during, and after during the Chinese Civil War. She
infuses the story with the perspective of an average Chiense citizen during that time
period - a perspective that is often lost in the average American education. But more on
that later. The one warning I would give readers though: her description of war-time
atrocities is very accurate. Perhaps too accurate for some people. And the saddest part
is that she's not making any of it up. She's describing the real atrocities committed
by Japanese soldiers during the second world war. If anything, there's a chance she
even toned it down.

She mixes in that history with her own idea of magic. In _The Poppy War_, Runin is a
lowly peasant who through hard work and determination, manages to earn her place in her
home country's (Nikara's) military academy. There, Runin discovers she's a shaman, and
possesses the ability to summon the power of a god. For Runin, it's a highly destructive
and uncontrollable Phoenix. But this is not just a tale of a girl with magical powers.
Instead, Kuang manages to weave an entire narrative about religious belief surrounding
Runin's power, and how the religious beliefs shape the interaction between Runin and
other foreigners with different religious beliefs. At the same time, she even adds
science fiction elements with characters trying to understand and control the power
Runin and other shamans possess through experimentation.

Somehow, the combination of all those elements just works. Kuang manages to balance the
science with religion, the eastern versus western religion, the history with the fiction
masterfully. But a few things really stuck out to me and I just had to find a place to
gush about it.
