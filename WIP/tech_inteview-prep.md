# Basics

## Attitude

The goal isn't to pass some arbitrary bar or a test. It's to check for a mutual fit
between the company and the candidate. It's easy to feel stressed and think that you
have no choice but to pass every interview. But once the candidate accepts that most
companies will simply be a bad fit - the candidate will feel more relaxed. It's easy to
let every failed interview get to one's head, but think about it - can anyone really be
friends with everyone? It's just not possible and that's how fit works. So instead of
trying to pass every interview, it's better to focus on just trying to see if the fit is
good and presenting an honest representation of oneself. So whenever I walk into an
interview, I remind myself that success or failure, it's always better to be honest
rather than trying to be something that I think they want.

## Quality over Quantity

Quality is always better than quantity. The first time I tried applying for jobs after a
PhD, I applied to 100 companies. And to be honest, I think I wasn't even interested in
50 of them. My success rate was unsurprising - only 7 first round interviews, and 0
second round interviews. I thought I was doing what I was supposed to do, but I was
actually just wasting effort. The two successful times I had, I was much more selective
about a company. One thing I did to determine if it's really worth the effort: see if I
can actually write one sentence about why I want to work there. This accomplishes a few
goals:
1. It feeds directly into starting the cover letter.
2. If I did get an interview, I would invariably be asked why I want to work there.
4. It helps ensure that I actually think the company could be a good fit.

This small exercise helped me focus on companies where at least I thought I would be a
good fit. It might take more research for each company to accomplish, but the effort
saves time in the long run.  The time saved let me actually focus on practicing for the
interviews I actually wanted rather than trying to hastily prepare for an interview so I
can submit more applications I didn't care about.

## Know What to Expect

Know what to expect in your chosen field. The first time I tired to solve a whiteboard coding
problem was the absolute first time I had ever even attempted it. I didn't know at all
what I should be doing, and it showed. This might be obvious to people, but it wasn't obvious to me and maybe not to everyone reading this. It really helps to know what the general class of interviews
to expect. For example, interviews in tech companies typically follow some mix of:
* Initial phone screens
* Cultural-fit interviews
* Coding interviews (whiteboard/online)
* Technical Skills interview

The strategy for preparing for each interview is different, and completely failing an
interview isn't going to improve your chances. So when I prepare for interviews, I try
to practice every area, and focus on the parts I'm weakest on. And then hopefully, I can do
okay on every interview rather than failing one of them.

## Interviewers are Here to Help!

Most interviewers aren't looking to fail a candidate. From their perspective, they needed to
hire 5 people yesterday and they've already interviewed dozens of candidates. So don't be afraid
to mix in questions if you're ever unsure. One thing I like to do if I'm ever unsure of my answer is ask, "Is this what you're looking for?" It's a very natural question and it helps make the interview
feel more interactive. Plus, if it's not, I've been given a second chance where the interviewer
will drill down to a more specific question.

# Soft Skills

This part is meant to focus on the initial phone screens and cultural-fit interviews.

## Figure out Your "Brand"

This one sound weird, but actually, it helps. I can tell you from experience, when I
interview, I hear a lot of the same answers to the same questions. One of the thing that
helps a candidate stand out, is if they have a consistent brand. In this case, a brand
is some set of attributes I can hold onto through multiple questions that really leaves
me with a feeling that I learned something about the candidate. To accomplish this, I
thought about the things that I was good at during my PhD and used that to form the
nucleus of all my answers. For example, I settled on a 3 things:
* I was very curious during my PhD - I mean, which academic isn't?
* I'm a builder - coding was fun because it let me build things.
* I will always be honest - I would admit my mistakes

So whenever I faced a new interview question, I would fall back to one of the brands.
And the best part is, it's possible to flip negatives into positives. For example, I
took 8 years to get a PhD - that's very long. And the reason is because I changed
dissertation topics after 3 years. For the longest time, I viewed that as a negative,
that I was indecisive and it took me longer than average to graduate. But actually, I
realized there's a positive aspect to it as well: I was curious enough to explore a
completely different field, and I was willing to take a risk to do so. That's actually
valuable now! Most interview questions are open ended so while I couldn't always tie
my answers back to a single brand, I would be able to do it for most. And I think that helped.
