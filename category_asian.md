Something I've been struggling with is understanding my Asian and
American identities. The older I get, the more I realize how I don't
quite fit into just an Asian mold, or just an American mold, and I'm
something in between. It touches every part of my life from work to
family. A big thanks goes to my wife, who's been helping me on this
journey.
