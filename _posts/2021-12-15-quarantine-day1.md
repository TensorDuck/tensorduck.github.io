## Breakfast

* Milk fish congee
* boiled egg
* Green vegetables
* Honeydew

Milk fish was interesting! It's not a very tender fish, but the flavor of the congee
more than made up for it. The basil garnish was a surprisingly good addition to congee
that I typically don't use when I make congee at home. The greens added some much needed
vitamins and the fruit was surprisingly juicy and sweet! I guess a tropical climate has
its benefits for food.

## Lunch

Bento box!
* Chicken and cucumber with peanuts
* Spicy lotus root
* Greens
* Steamed egg with ham, corn and green onions
* Seaweed soup
* Passion fruit

Very flavorful, but also very heavy. Was craving something lighter after all that
traveling. Still, the variety of flavors was really intriguing.In the main bento box,
the flavors ranged from spicy, to savory, to sweet to bitter. And the passion fruit
added a really sour element at the end of the meal. Fortunately the seaweed soup was
easy on the stomach. I think Taiwanese cuisine just involves many strong bold flavors.

My learning from the meal: real passion fruit is so much more sour than passion fruit in
boba drinks! I was not prepared.

The surprise winner was the steamed egg - the amount of flavor packed into this tiny
steamed egg dish was such a treat.

## Dinner

Another Bento!
* Bbq pork (2 different styles)
* Cauliflower
* Sliced wood-ear mushrooms
* Steamed egg mixed with vegetables
* Daikon soup on the side.

By this point, I was hoping for some relief from the heavy foods, but alas, there was
none! However, I couldn't complain too long. I'm a huge sucker for green onions and
paired with the bbq pork is one of my favorite flavors. And of course there was a minor
chuckle to find half hte green onions stuck to the roof of the bento box. The side
dishes were a good compliment, but nothing in particular stood out by this point.

The soup however was a very refreshing end to the meal and did help cut down on the
heavy oil from the pork. The photo isn't great but there are tiny pieces of daikon at
the bottom of the bowl. Overall, a very solid "ration" from the quarantine hotel.

After a full day of eating Taiwanese quarantine food, I realized I was going to love
eating in Taiwan!
