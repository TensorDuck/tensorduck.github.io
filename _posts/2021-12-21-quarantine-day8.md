We get one more bonus meal - the hotel gave us breakfast before we checked out.

## Breakfast

Finally a congee bowl:
* Egg with basil and dried radish
* Gluten in heavy sauce
* Celery with sliced imitation crab and tofu
* Yu-choy
* Pig ear
* Sunkist orange

This was an interesting meal to end on. It was pretty simple, but felt like one of the
heavier breakfasts we had. Perhaps to make up for the light lunch the previous day? In
any case, all the sides went well with the congee. In particular, I enjoyed the yu-choy
as a light element, and the gluten was a nice flavorful heavy element in the congee.

For people who haven't had pig ear before,  I would definitely recommend trying it in a
congee first. Pig ear can get quite oily. So having something light to wash it down
brings the flavor out, or else all you will taste is the pig fat.

Also, basil and egg was a dish I was only recently introduced to by my wife. It appears
to be a Taiwanese favorite, and generally I find the basil to be a refreshing, but also
very strong addition to eggs. Personally, I will always enjoy a simple over-medium egg
covered in pepper, but that's just me. But basil and eggs is well worth a try at least!

All in all, I was just glad to get one more meal from the hotel before we left. It
really worked out! And all that remained was furiously packing our things so we can make
the quarantine taxi to our next quarantine location.
