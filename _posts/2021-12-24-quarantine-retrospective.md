I wanted to write down my experience with quarantine as a way to combat the many
negative reviews of quarantining in Taiwan. While the procedures seemed harsh to me
initially, I felt that it was a necessary step to achieving an unbelievably small number
of covid cases. Consider, Taiwan might be the only nation in the world where the endemic
level of Covid is currently 0-cases.

Many of the complaints around quarantine centered on being locked in a tiny room, which
just seems like an unavoidable compromise any traveler to Taiwan has to make right now.
But the additional complaints on the quality of food surprised me after my experience.
Granted I stayed in a good hotel ("YOUR Hotel" - Taipei), so my experience would always
be biased. Although, some of the food I've seen from government run facilities looks
really good as well. Admittedly, some government facilities would have very spartan
rooms themselves, which is one of the reasons why we chose a hotel to mitigate some of
the drawbacks of a spartan room.

In any case, the food quality honestly blew me away. For example there was the
[breakfast on day 7]({% link _posts/2021-12-21-quarantine-day7.md %}#breakfast)
(potato hash brown burger) and
[day 4]( {% link _posts/2021-12-18-quarantine-day4.md %}#breakfast)
(scallion pancakes with chicken) that were just downright tasty. And the
[dinner from day 1]({% link _posts/2021-12-15-quarantine-day1.md%}#dinner)
(bbq pork bento) was just a well put-together meal. Many of these boxes I can easily
imagine paying 10+ USD in the US, so I never had a feeling of missing out or being given
sub-par food from the hotel.


Even the worst meal, the
[lunch from day 7]({% link _posts/2021-12-21-quarantine-day7.md %}#lunch),
(rice ball soup) didn't feel cheap so much as just small. This kind of dish is not
considered a cheap item relative to the other lunches we received, and it was nice to
have a thematic holiday meal at the time anyways. The main drawback of just being too
light was mitigated since the hotel can handle deliveries. And to that final point - the
fact that a hotel can handle an arbitrary number of deliveries just means that you can
effectively eat whatever you want.

All in all, it was a fun experience to be locked in a room for a week and have meals
delivered to you at set intervals. We definitely all started to experience a Pavlov's
dog effect by day 2 where we were eagerly awaiting and listening for the meal delivery.
And it's hard to complain when don't have cooking duties for a whole week. I think it
all comes down to framing. As my wife likes to joke, I am American after all, and a
natural optimist, so I try to make the most of the situation I have. So really, it could
have been much worse, and it ended up being pretty fun.
