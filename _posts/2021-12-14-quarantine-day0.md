We just arrived at the hotel exhausted, and a bento box was waiting for us!

Meal:
* Fried pork-chop
* fried-tofu
* Napa cabbage
* bamboo shoots.

The first meal I had after getting off the plane in Taiwan. The hotel had these boxes
ready for us when we arrived.

Great flavor overall! I thought I would only eat a few bites since I was severely
jet-lagged and tired from the flight. But surprisingly! I finished the whole box in one
go, just one-bite after the other. Only weird thing was the pork chop had a heavy sauce,
but was also breaded and fried. I wonder if that could've been better balanced: less
sauce so it's crispier, or less breading so the sauce stands out.
