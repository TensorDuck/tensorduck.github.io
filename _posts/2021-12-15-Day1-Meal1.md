Meal: Milk fish congee with a boiled egg. Green vegetables and fruit on the side.

Milk fish was interesting! Not a very tender fish, but the flavor of the congee was
amazing and the basil garnish was a surprisingly good addition. The greens were okay but
the fruit was surprisingly juicy and sweet! I guess a tropical climate has its benefits
for food.
