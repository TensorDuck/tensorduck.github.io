A very unhealthy day of food. I am starting to look forward to the end of quarantine.

## Breakfast

* Deep-fried flat bread sandwich
* Deep-fried long-dough inside
* Soy milk

Now this is a food that out Americas America. It's deep-fried flat bread sandwich, and
the inside is more deep-fried dough. The intention is that there would be a bowl of soy
milk to dip the bread into, but sadly, there we only had soy milk to drink. Still,
despite appearances, the food is actually quite good. It actually brings back memories
of my grandparents. They were always fond of eating this kind of food for brunch on
weekends. It never ceases to amaze me how food can bring you back to a happy memory.

## Lunch

A noodle bowl with beef and seafood.
* Slice of beef
* Fried egg
* Fish cake
* Mushroom
* Meatball
* Slice of Squid
* Some vegetables

This meal honestly came as a shock. It had so few vegetable and lower variety. Our
working hypothesis by this point is that the hotel is providing smaller lighter meals on
this day because so many guests ordered night market food the previous night!

In any case, the broth was the best part. It had a light savory flavor and was slightly
thickened. However, there was only one of each ingredient, I felt the meal changed
substantially as I ate more of the food.

It starts off as a very beef focused noodle bowl.

And then became a very squid focused noodle bowl.

In the end, the meal was kind of light and not particularly exciting. On top of that, it
was relatively low on vegetables. As fun as it was to mix things up, by this point, the
day felt like the lightest day for food. Maybe quarantine meals are finally starting to
wear us down?

## Bonus

So because the first two meals of the day were so disappointing, we decided to get some
takeout. This was from a cafe called Louisa, and it was a black forest boston cream pie
cake. It was pretty rich, and not too heavy on the chocolate flavor, but the cream was
light and fluffy!

## Dinner

* Rice bowl
* Cabbage
* Greens
* Spicy lotus root
* Spicy chicken

Back to something more typical, maybe I've been conditioned to prefer typical meals now
from the hotel? In any case, this meal was flavorful, but also the spiciest meal of our
stay so far. We were guessing it was a Thai inspired dish since it had hints of lemon
and basil with the heavy spice. I was glad the final quarantine meal of the day ended
on a good note.

## Second Bonus - Fried Chicken

So because we were all still feeling a bit unsatisfied from the day, we ended up
ordering some more food from "Taiwan Chicken" on the Food Panda App. Honestly, it felt
like a great final cap to the day to be able to eat some popcorn chicken, fried silk
melon, sweet potato fries white pepper, and finally fried taro. I was so excited I
didn't get a picture!

It's interesting, by this point, I realize I might be really accustomed to their more
typical meal boxes. But I'm also starting to crave the freedom to eat what I want.
