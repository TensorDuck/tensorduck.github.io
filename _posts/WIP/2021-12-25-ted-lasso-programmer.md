I recently binged Apple TV's Ted Lasso and it ocurred to me: Ted Lasso would make the
perfect programmer. Hear me out! I know it's a show about an American football coach
going to England to coach football (err soccer?), and there's no one coding anything
anywhere in the whole series. But I think much of Ted Lasso's personality lends itself
to an ideal coding partner. So while I was drawn to the show to watch the quirky clash
of American optimism with British pessimism, I stayed because the show had a real heart
to it that described real life lessons worth living by. So I wanted to just write down
all the moments that made me realize Ted Lasso would be an ideal coding partner.

WARNING: Below contains spoilers for the entirety of the first 2 seasons.

## Don't be afraid of diving into something new completely blind

Early on in season 1, Ted Lasso's shift from coaching American football to British
football is met with skepticism. But this is not the diving into something new I meant!
It's actually a moment where he tries curry for the first time, and orders the spiciest
version out of politeness to his host. For anyone who's ever eaten curry - you know this
is a terrible idea. But Ted orders this without hesitation, or fear, or even
understanding of what awaits him. Some might say this is ignorant, but no one person can
know everything so inevitably you will encounter something new, and this is especially
true with programming.

During my programing career, the things that held me back weren't a lack of skill.
Everything I learned now was something I was clearly capable of learning at the time.
What slowed me down the most was instead fear. I was afraid that learning a new topic,
or diving into a seemingly more complicated way of doing things would take too much
time. So instead I found costly workarounds and actively would avoid diving into a new
set of docs. Well, I regretted all those moments, because I inevitably will hit a wall
that I couldn't work around and now I had to dive into the new docs. I wish I had just
done so from the start, instead of making excuses.

Programmers should dive into new methods and concepts the same way Ted Lasso chows down
on new cuisine - without fear or hesitation.

## Always be curious

Curiosity is a big part of Ted's character ...


## Forgive people for mistakes, even major ones

he forgives Rebecca for being a tool

## You can't force mentorship, you can only guide it

He turns Roy into an amazing mentor
