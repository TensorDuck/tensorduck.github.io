Meal: Purple rice bento. Pepper chicken, daikon, napa with mushrooms, and salad.

A much lighter tasting dinner from the previous day, but that was honestly welcome relief. While the chicken was flavorful and tasty, the multiple vegetable dishes were low on oil and honestly stuck out more to me. The biggest surprise was how much I enjoyed the salad. I don't normally go for salads or raw vegetables in general, but it had an interesting sharp flavor while still feeling very light.
