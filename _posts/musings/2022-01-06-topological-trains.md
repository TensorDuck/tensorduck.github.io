Riding the metro in Taipei is amazing. It's quiet, smooth and very clean. So I thought:
the metro is just like a road except easier to navigate. Well, I guess it has set stops.
And the metro uses trains and not cars. And I suppose it's exclusively underground
unlike most roads. I guess, it's easier to navigate and simply topologically equivalent
to a road.
