excerpt: "I met a most interesting person today"
---

I had dinner with one of my wife's friends today. He mentioned he managed to
double his salary by trading stocks. What an accomplishment! So naturally I
wanted to know what his secret was. Well, it was a simple answer - discipline.
He spent 10 years reading and studying every detail about every market he
invested in. I guess there really are no shortcuts in life, just work. Hard
work.
