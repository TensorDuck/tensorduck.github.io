I had an emotional reaction to a building. I know nothing about architecture. But when I
saw Taipei 101 for the first time up close, I felt something. I tried to put it into
words. I think the architecture is a great mix of modern with ancient. The face is pure
glass making it feel modern, but the shape of the building feels ancient. I don't know
why, but somehow the architect mixed those two styles perfectly and made me stand in awe
for a few minutes.
