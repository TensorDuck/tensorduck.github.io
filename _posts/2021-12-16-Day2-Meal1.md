Meal: Sandwich with onions, ham and cucumbers. An apple on the side.

A very refreshing breakfast after eating so many oily and greasy meals the previous
days. I liked how onions were perfectly sauted to that point where they're just turning
sweet but are still sharp. It worked nicely with the refreshing cucumber and the ham.

It's weird, I was expecting this breakfast to be a lot heavier than it was. I was so
excited after my first bite that I almost finished the whole sandwich before I
remembered to snap a quick photo.
