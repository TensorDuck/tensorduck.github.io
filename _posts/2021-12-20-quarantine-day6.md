After a disappointing day 5, will day 6 improve?

## Breakfast

* Gyoza
* Chicken nuggets
* Orange
* Fiber-juice box

This breakfast wasn't bad, but it did not feel like breakfast. The gyoza, or at least
they taste like gyoza, was about as good as you can expect. The chicken nuggets were
also good. Overall, an improvement from the previous day's fried dough sandwich. Will
the rally continue in lunch?


## Lunch

* Fried fish
* Half egg and a slice of sausage
* Taro
* String beans
* Cabbage with carrots
* Papaya
* Radish root soup

This was a huge improvement from the previous day's lunch, or maybe I was just glad to
return to the tried and true bento lunch box. The fried fish was a little crispy still,
even though the steam from being transported to our rooms probably softened it a little
too much. The cabbage dish in particular was very well done. It tasted similar to a dish
that my wife and I make routinely using ginger and dried shrimp as seasoning.

I also love that the restaurants would just add a single slice of sausage to the bento
box. I realize it's just not something the average person can do at home. After all,
who has the time to cook a singular slice of sausage to throw into their lunch? I like
these small touches and that it seems like they take every effort to cover as much of the rice
as possible with something different. And rather than just trying to stuff every box with
the same filler ingredients, they have some different pieces every time.

## Dinner

* Braised pork knuckle
* Fried tofu
* Egg
* Bok choy
* Cabbage
* Seaweed in hot water

This ended an overall great meal with one hilarious bad dish.
First, the good parts: The braised pork-knuckle was very tasty and the flavor of the
pork really shined. The vegetables were mostly just sauted and were tasty but nothing special.

Honestly, the craziest part was the seaweed. I thought it would be a soup, but the second
I drink it, I realize it's just hot water. And there's seaweed at the bottom that has
almost none of the umami flavor that seaweed should have. Honestly, if the seaweed
was just thrown to the side and we were given a cup of hot water, it would have been
better.

Day 6 was a definitive improvement from day 5. A lot of good dishes, and still nice that
the main course of each box was something I haven't tried here yet. Hopefully, going
into ou last full day of quarantine, the hotel can keep this up.
