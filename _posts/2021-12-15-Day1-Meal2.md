Meal: Bento box! Chicken and cucumber with peanuts. Spicy lotus root, greens, and a
steamed egg with ham and, corn and green onions. Seaweed soup on the side with a passion
fruit.

Very flavorful, but also very heavy. Was craving something lighter after all that
traveling, but it was very flavorful at least. The variety of flavors struck me as
really interesting. The flavors ranged from spicy, to savory, to sweet to bitter and
finally super sour. I think Taiwanese food just loves many strong bold flavors.

Real passion fruit is so much more sour than passion fruit in boba drinks! I was not
prepared.

The surprise winner was the steamed egg - the amount of flavor packed into this tiny
steamed egg dish was amazing.
