Meal: Fried pork-chop with fried-tofu, napa cabbage, and bamboo shoots.

The first meal I had after getting off the plane in Taiwan. The hotel had these boxes
ready for us when we arrived.

Great flavor overall! I thought I would only eat a few bites since I was severely
jet-lagged and tired from the flight. But surprisingly! I finished the whol box in one
go, just one-bite after the other. Only weird thing was the pork chop had a heavy sauce,
but was also breaded and fried. I wonder if that could've been better balanced: less
sauce so it's crispier, or less breading so the sauce stands out.
