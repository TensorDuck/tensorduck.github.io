Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. I am not recommending any investments to
enter into. Everyone should do their own research prior to entering an investment.

 When I started off, I had this notion that I can definitely beat the broader market
(i.e. a S&P 500 index fund). That was hubris. In an effort to better understand my
investing decisions, I decided to aggressively reevaluate all the trades I've made and
why. Hoping to see what went wrong, I sat down and wrote out every trade I've made in
the last 2 years in a spreadsheet and wrote down everything I remember, the notes I made
about why I made a purchase, and why I sold. I learned two big lessons as a result.

The first lesson I learned: it's really hard to pick stocks that beat the broader
market! One of the mistakes I made was buying a wide-array of stocks without fully
understanding why. At first glance, I thought I could hedge my bets where maybe one of
the companies I picked would suddenly have a huge gain, and it'll offset the modest
gains, and losses, of the other companies. I realize now that I effectively created a
mini-index fund that is a worse replica of the broader market. Hence, going forward,
I've learned it's better to pick a few stocks I understand and can actually follow,
rather than wildly hedging bets.

The second lesson I learned: any pattern I think I see in a stock price is likely not
actually there. I made some bets where I thought I saw a cyclical pattern I can take
advantage of. That was wrong, and that ended up being my most costly loss of the year.
The reality is: there are experts who are paid to study patterns in the market and try
to beat it. I am not better than those experts. If I were, I would be be working with
those experts. So instead of trying to trade on technical analysis alone, I think it's
better to trade primarily on the value a company generates. It's boring and doesn't
sound as exciting. But the companies that ended up performing better in my portfolio
based on my betting there would be more demand for their goods and services. So going
forward, I want to focus on value investing in the fundamentals and doing more deep
dives to really understand what the business is and how the company actually makes more
money.

Looking  back on my year of practicing investments, I realize I was making bets, not
investments. It was easy to trick myself into thinking I was making wise investments,
but a few bets will knock everything down. So I moving forward, I hope to be more
careful with my investments. Maybe in a year, I'll do another retro and see if my new
strategy works.
