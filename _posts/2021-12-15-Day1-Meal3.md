Meal: Rice bento box. Crispy bbq pork, cauliflower, sliced wood-ear mushrooms and a
steamed egg mixed with vegetables. A daikon soup on the side.

By this point, I was hoping for some relief from the heavyfoods, but alas, there was
none! However, I couldn't complain. I'm a sucker for green onions and paired with the
bbq pork it was amazing. The side dishes were also tasty, but nothing in particular
stood out. The soup however was a very refreshing end to the meal and did help cut down
on the heavy oil from the pork. Overall, a very solid pairing.

By this point, I realized I was giong to love eating in Taiwan!
