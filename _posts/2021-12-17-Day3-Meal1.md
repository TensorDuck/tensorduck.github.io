Meal: French-toast sandwich with peanut-butter, sliced beef, and lettuce. A side of
fruit.

I was VERY surprised by this one. The sandwich was tasty, but it was a very unique
combination of flavors that somehow worked. I thought it would clash with the beef, but
it somehow worked. Another use of peanut butter that I'm excited to tryout for myself
sometime!
