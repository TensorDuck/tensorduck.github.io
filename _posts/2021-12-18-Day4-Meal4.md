Meal:
* Scallion pancake with chicken and egg
* Papaya
* Sweet black ceylon tea

On this particular day, I had woken up at 3AM for some meetings so I was famished.
Luckily, the scallion pancake hit the spot! The soy-based sauce was perfectly light
compliment to the fried package. The chicken had a nice smokey flavor and gave it that
sunday morning bacon feel. Finally, the fruit and tea was a refreshing compliment.

Overall a wholesome breakfast that feels like something you can easily recreate at
home!
