Going into day 2, I'm so far impressed with the variety. Let's see if it can continue
for another day.

## Breakfast

* Breakfast sandwich with onions, ham and cucumbers

A very refreshing breakfast after eating so many oily and greasy meals the previous
days. I liked how onions were perfectly sauted to that point where they're just turning
sweet but are still sharp.

It's weird, I was expecting this breakfast to be a lot heavier than it was. The
cucumbers really made a huge difference. Unfortunately, it did mean I was so excited
when eating the sandwich, I almost finished the whole sandwich before my wife and sister
in law reminded me to snap a photo.

The sandwich was so good, I almost forgot we didn't actually get a breakfast fruit this
time. Though, I wonder if the hotel didn't want to have the fruit clash too much with
the onion flavor. If so, they are really putting a lot of thought into making all the
flavors mesh well with each other.

## Lunch

Bento box!
* Fried pork chop
* Fried tofu
* Starch with sauce
* Green vegetables (really need to start asking for names of these things)
* Fried seafood patty
* Napa cabbage.
* Apple

Was happy to see that we at least have fruit for lunch!

The fried pork chop was nice and crispy this time! It had a very satisfying crunch.
sadly, the fried seafood patty was a bit of a let down since it was low on flavor and
too high on crunch.

The starch with sauce was a really fun dish though! Not sure what's in the sauce, or
what the starch is made of for that matter. All I know is, it tasted really good and had
a fun jelly-like texture.

Overall, the fried pork chop stuck out the most, simply because of how well it was fried
and seasoned.

## Dinner

Bento box, now with purple rice!
* Pepper chicken
* Boiled daikon
* Napa with mushrooms
* And some sort of salad?

A much lighter tasting dinner from the previous day, but that was honestly a welcome
relief. While the chicken was flavorful and tasty, the multiple vegetable dishes were
low on oil and honestly stuck out more to me. I'm guessing the vegetables being a
completely different style from previous meals helped add contrast to the overall day's
meals.

The biggest surprise was how much I enjoyed the salad. I don't normally go for salads or
raw vegetables in general, but it had an interesting sharp flavor while still feeling
very light.

Pretty impressed with the level of effort they put into ensuring variety in the meals.
