Meal:
* Rice bowl
* Silk melon with noodles
* Whole fried fish
* Taiwanese spinach
* Blood cake with three-cup sauce

I was initially shocked to see a whole deep-fried fish. But fortunately, it was easy to
eat and apparently part of the appeal is that the fish will still have roe inside of it.
The silk melon was surprisingly good, but the extra noodles didn't seem necessary given
how much starch was already in the meal.

Finally, the blood cake was probably the most interesting and maybe my favorite item in
this meal. Never had it with three-cup sauce, and this seemed like a particularly well
done three-cup sauce. I always found blood cake to be too chewy relative to the flavor
it provides, so the sauce completely changed that perception.

Overall, some very unique items today! I was very pleased to try so many new items
today!
