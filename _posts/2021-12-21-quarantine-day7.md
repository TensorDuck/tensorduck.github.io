The final full day of quarantine... will the rally continue?

## Breakfast

* Hash brown burger with ham, egg, lettuce, onions, cucumber
* Sunkiss orange
* Apple juice

Much to my surprise, this might be the best breakfast I had so far in quarantine. It didn't look like much initially. To be honest,
I thought I would only be eating some ham with eggs between some bread, but the inside of the burger ended up being packed with flavor:

So far, this is the most American tasting food I've had in Taiwan. Even though the hash
brown wasn't very crunchy, the potato itself was very well shredded and had a smooth
texture. The apple juice and fruit was a great compliment to the whole burger and felt
refreshing after eating all the onion. I thought we were off to a great start for the
day, but alas, lunch had other plans.

## Lunch

* This rice ball soup with some vegetables

This was probably the biggest let-down of the whole quarantine stay. The food itself was
good quality. It's the winter solstice so the meal was very thematic with the day.
Unfortunately, thematic food doesn't fill an empty stomach so we ended up digging into
the instant noodle packs we received to make up for it.

Flavor wise, it was a very good broth. The rice balls had a good quantity of meat mixed
inside some of the larger ones, and were a good consistency. However, this was a
definitive fail of a meal. Luckily, we ended up with a bonus meal today as well!

## Bonus

So fortunately, my sister-in-law's friend ordered some dim sum from a 1 Michelin Star
restaurant called [TimHoWan](http://www.timhowan.com.tw/).

Now that was some good dim-sum. The shrimp inside the shrimp dumplings was still firm
and flavorful. The radish cake had great radish flavor, though it was a bit too soft for
my personal preference. The shrimp in fried-tofu wraps was perfect in both flavor and
texture - I actually don't know how they can get the outside to be so crispy in a deep
fryer without it feeling too oily. Finally, the char-siu-bao was perhaps the best
char-siu-bao I ever had. It was a nice touch to add crisp sugar on top, I didn't realize
how well that would tie the whole dish together.

Maybe it was just the hunger from lunch, but this meal was great. Though, I realize now
we can never complain about quarantine food because it's clear we can eat Michelin Star
level meals if we truly wanted to.

## Dinner

* Pork belly with a thickened soy sauce
* Pumpkin
* Glass noodle with spicy cucumber
* Mixed cabbage and greens

Not a bad meal, and it's back to the variety of flavors I expected! The glass noodles
and cucumber was surprisingly spicy. Then the flavor profile becomes savory with the
pork belly and the pumpkin was a little sweet. All in all, the meals ended on a high
note at YOUR hotel.

This day was definitely a mixed bag. Breakfast started out as the best meal the hotel
has provided while lunch was probably the worst meal the hotel has provided. But, I
would never complain about the sheer variety that Taiwanese cuisine waws able to offer
with just a few simple concepts.
