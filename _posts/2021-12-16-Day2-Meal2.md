Meal: Rice bento box. Fried pork chop with a a piece of fried tofu. Sides was a starch
thing, green things, a fried seafood patty, and napa cabbage.

The fried pork chop was nice and crispy this time! The fried seafood patty was a bit of
a let down: not as much seafood flavor as I wanted. Not sure what's in the sauced
starch, but it was surprisingly tasty and a had a fun jelly-like texture!

Overall, the fried pork chop stuck out the most, simply because of how well done it was.
