Slight return to normalcy, but still some new dishes. Perhaps hotel quarantine is
wearing on me.

## Breakfast

* Scallion pancake with chicken and egg
* Papaya
* Sweet black ceylon tea

On this particular day, I had woken up at 3AM for some meetings so I was famished.
Luckily, the scallion pancake hit the spot! The soy-based sauce was perfectly light
compliment to the fried package. The chicken had a nice smokey flavor and gave it that
sunday morning bacon feel.

The fruit and tea was a refreshing compliment to the rest of the meal. It made the
overall breakfast feel wholesome, and it's something that I feel I can easily recreate
in my own kitchen.

## Lunch

* Curry chicken
* Sauted lettuce
* Wood ear with cilantro
* Napa cabbage
* Flour soup
* pineapple

A much more normal meal. We discussed the different kinds of Asian curies there are. The
style of curry in Taiwan is actually quite runny. Apparently, In order to emulate other
curries, the Taiwanese focused on getting the color closer to yellow, rather than
changing the texture and flavor.As a result, I think I always preferred this kind of
sweet and savory curry over the incredibly spicy varieties.

The cilantro on the wood ear was a nice touch, can't say I've tried that before,
although it is typical in the area. THe other vegetable dishes worked well, but didn't
stick out. I'm starting to think there has to be a standard set of sides that's repeated
in these different boxes.

One interesting thing to note was the soup today. It apparently involved some kind of
boiled flower with bits of pork at the bottom. The result was a soup that wasn't very
salty, but it was very fragrant. It was an interesting experience to take in flavor
primarily through the nose. I have to say, it was a lot of fun.

## Dinner

* Rice bowl
* Green vegetables
* Beef with sauce (We think it's oyster-sauce like?)
* Tofu with cucumber
* Pickled sauted daikon with carrots

It was interesting, that even on day 4, there's interesting new items in each meal. The
beef was well done and the sauce was great, though we couldn't figure out what they did
with the sauce exactly. The tofu dish was interesting. Though I realized at the end of
the meal, the cucumber was an essential element to cut down on the sourness. The funny
story there is: they forgot to slice my cucumber so I had just one big cucumber chunk,
but my wife had slices of cucumber in her dish that made it a lot better!

The final dish that was strange was the daikon. I couldn't quite place what happened
with it. It seemed kind of picled, but it was clearly cooked with carrots. But it wasn't
cooked so much that the flavor became sweet. Instead, it had a soft outside and a bit
harder when biting into it.

Not my favorite dishes today, but I at least had something interesting in every meal.
