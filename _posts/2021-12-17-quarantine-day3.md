Going into this day, I thought I understood the routine. Three times a day, you get a
box of food with several dishes. But today, every meal was a little different!

## Breakfast

* French-toast sandwich with peanut butter, beef and lettuce.
* Sunkist
* Milk tea

I was VERY surprised by this meal. The sandwich had peanut butter on it, the bread was
clearly meant to be french-toast like, and it had beef and lettuce as well.

I thought all the flavors would clash more than it did, but I was happy that somehow,
all the flavors mixed together. Definitely some new combination to try when I get home!

## Lunch

A noodle Bowl?!
* Thin noodles with some kind of light soy-based sauce
* Beef and Onions
* Bok-choy
* Sunny-side up egg
* Chowder with corn (not pictured)

This meal was really weird. I was expecting surely another bento box, but was pleasantly
surprised to find a noodle bowl!

I'm one of those people that actually enjoys noodles more than rice. But even I felt a
distinct drop in joy between the first and last bite of the bowl. Really shows how too
much of a good thing can actually become bad at the end. But I love noodles so I was
glad to eat it.

The unassuming chowder won the day though. I didn't think much of it, but after taking
one sip, I started drinking it straight from the bowl. Its flavor and texture was just
perfect. In retrospect, I should've used it as a pallet cleanser.

## Dinner

* Rice bowl
* Silk melon with noodles
* Whole fried fish
* Taiwanese spinach
* Blood cake with three-cup sauce

I was initially shocked to see a whole deep-fried fish. But fortunately, it was easy to
eat. The silk melon was surprisingly good, but the extra noodles didn't seem necessary
given how much starch was already in the meal.

The one interesting thing about the fish is that it still had roe inside of it. It gave
it a very interesting texture and taste between the roe, the fish meat, and the
deep-fried outside. ![dinner-main](/assets/taiwan_2021/day3_meal3b.jpg)

Finally, the blood cake was probably the most interesting and maybe my favorite item in
this meal. Never had it with three-cup sauce, and this seemed like a particularly well
done three-cup sauce. I always found blood cake to be too chewy relative to the flavor
it provides, so the sauce completely changed that perception.

Overall, some very unique items today! It was a lot of fun to have a huge boost in
variety of dishes all of a sudden.
