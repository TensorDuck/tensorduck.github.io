Meal: Bowl of noodles with beef, sunny-side up egg, and bok-choy. A side of corn chowder and a banana.

This meal was really weird. The noodles were tasty, but it was just so much noodle! There was a distinct drop between the joy I had at the first bite and the joy I had at the last bite. Really shows how too much of a good thing can actually become bad at the end. But I love noodles so I was glad to eat it.

The unassuming chowder won the day though. I didn't think much of it, but after taking one sip, I started drinking it straight from the bowl. Its flavor and texture was just perfect.
