Hi all! Thanks for checking out my blog. I started this blog as a way to help me think.
Just like how programmers will often talk to rubber ducks (hence the name!), I like
screaming my thoughts out to the void. In the process, I hope I can learn something new.
Hence, my motto - always be curious.

Hopefully you also learn something new.
